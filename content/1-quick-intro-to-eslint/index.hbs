## What's linter?

> generically, lint or a linter is any tool that flags suspicious usage in software written in any computer language. â€“ via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)

## Why you should use one

- static analysis helps identify syntax and other code errors without code execution
- the same process can be used to validate code style rules

## Other tools beside ESLint

- [JSLint][1]: The grandfather of JavaScript code quality tools, written by Douglas Crockford.
- [JSHint][2]: JSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team's coding conventions.
- [JSCS][3]: JSCS is a code style linter/formatter for programmatically enforcing your style guide.

JSLint is too inflexible. Until ESLint became available may projects used a combination of JSHint and JSCS to provide a good coverage for style and errors.

## Why ESLint

- Plugin based architecture (Browserify, Webpack, Gulp, and many more show this works rather well)
- Uses an AST which allows more complex rules
- Provides a vast amount of rules for possible errors, best practices, variable handling, node.js, stylistic issues, and very good support for **ES2015** & **ES2016**!
- Very easy configuration which even allows for inheritance which helps in large projects
- High test coverage
